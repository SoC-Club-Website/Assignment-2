<h3>General instructions:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Use separate HTML and CSS files. Try to avoid using the style tag in the HTML file.</li>
	<li>We will look at your coding style also. So try to make the code as neat, clean, understandable and modular as possible.</li>
	<li>Since this is your first assignment, you are expected to make mistakes..(and improve later :p)</li>

<ul>
	<li>About Me :- Name, Hobbies, Ambitions etc. </li>
	<li>Gallery :- This will contain 4 images and a video arranged like what is shown in the image below, note that do not add anchor link as it will direct the user to youtube. We want the video to play on the website itself.( The images can be anything, your pics, your fav anime, fav movies etc. depending on your creativity) <br>
	<br>
